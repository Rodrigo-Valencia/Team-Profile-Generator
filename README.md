# Team Profile Generator

## Description
A generator that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. 

## Tasks Completed 
* Built entire application using object-oriented programming (OOP), separating data and functionality into different constructor functions.
* Used modern ES6 class syntax to implement inheritance between classes. 
* Verified that the code worked as intended through automated tests using the Jest framework.
* Took user input and used template literals to dynamically generate an entire HTML page directly from the command line.
